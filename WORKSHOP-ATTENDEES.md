## Key Insight

This is a **leadership audience**, not end-user admin/clerical workers.

They care about:
- ROI and time savings
- Scalability without headcount
- Compliance and audit readiness
- Integration with existing systems
- Visibility into operations

They do NOT care about:
- Technical implementation details
- AI feature demonstrations for their own sake
- Anything that adds complexity without clear value
