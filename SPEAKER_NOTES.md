# SPEAKER NOTES
### Document Processing AI Workshop

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 1: DOCUMENTS ARE EVERYWHERE
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Ground them in the reality they already live. Documents aren't going away — they're the lifeblood of operations.**

---

## 💬 OPEN WITH:

> "Before we dive into anything technical, I want to start with something you already know — something so obvious it's almost invisible..."

**Build the list:**
- Every day, documents flow into your operation — **purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading, delivery receipts**
- On the compliance side — **food safety certifications, audit documentation, quality reports, phytosanitary certificates**
- Here's the stat that matters: **80% of business data doesn't live in your ERP. It lives in documents.**
- And somewhere, right now, someone is **reading a PDF and typing numbers into a system** instead of doing the work they were actually hired for.

---

## ❓ ENGAGE THEM:
> "Think about what flows through YOUR operation every single day. How many different document types? How many hands touch them?"

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"Now — you might be wondering why I'm leading a technology workshop by stating the obvious. Here's why: this 'boring' problem turns out to be the PERFECT fit for AI. Let me show you why..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 2: THE #1 AI USE CASE
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Establish credibility immediately. This isn't experimental — it's the most battle-tested AI application in enterprise.**

---

## 💬 DELIVER WITH CONVICTION:

> "There's a lot of AI hype out there. Chatbots, image generators, predictions about the future of work. But when you look at where AI is actually delivering MEASURABLE results — not hype, not pilots, ACTUAL production results..."

**Land the punchline:**
> "Document processing is #1. By a wide margin. **76% of enterprises** put this at the top of their automation priorities."

**Explain why it works:**
- The ROI is **crystal clear** — you can literally count hours saved and errors eliminated
- It's **low risk** — AI assists humans, it doesn't replace judgment on important decisions
- It's **universal** — every department, every function has documents
- And critically — **the technology is production-ready.** This isn't research. Companies are running this at scale, today.

---

## 🎤 PERSONAL VALIDATION:

> "And I can tell you from our own practice — we've had clients reach out specifically for the invoice and receipt use case. Finance teams doing manual reconciliation, spending hours matching paperwork. It's a pain point people are actively trying to solve. This isn't us convincing anyone they have a problem — **they already know they do.**"

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"So let's get concrete. What does this problem actually LOOK like in a real operation? I'd bet money this sounds familiar..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 3: THE DOCUMENT CHAOS
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Make them FEEL the pain they already know. Paint a picture so vivid they're nodding along.**

---

## 💬 BUILD THE FRUSTRATION:

> "Let me paint a picture. Tell me if this sounds familiar..."

**Walk through the chaos:**
- Invoices arrive as **PDFs attached to emails, sometimes scanned paper, sometimes faxes** — yes, faxes still exist
- Bills of lading are **buried in someone's inbox**, maybe forwarded, maybe not
- Delivery receipts? They're in a **filing cabinet somewhere**, or on a clipboard in a truck, or photographed on someone's phone
- And then **someone has to sit down, read each one, and type that data into your system.** Every. Single. Time.
- The industry average error rate? **4%.** That means out of every 100 documents, 4 have something wrong. And you won't find out until there's a problem.

---

## 🌱 GREENHOUSE HOOK:
> "Meanwhile, there's a **crop that needs scouting**. A **harvest that needs coordinating**. Production work that's NOT getting done because someone's tied to a desk doing data entry."

---

## ❓ PAUSE AND ASK:
> "Quick mental exercise — how many hours a week does your team spend on paperwork? Just... sit with that number for a second."

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"That frustration you're feeling? It has a dollar sign attached. Let me show you what this actually costs..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 4: THE REAL NUMBERS
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Turn frustration into dollars. Let them do the math for their own operation and realize the scale.**

---

## 📊 DROP THESE NUMBERS:

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| Cost per invoice (manual) | **$15-25** |
| Finance time on data entry | **60%** |
| Deliveroo before automation | **15 min/invoice** |
| Deliveroo after | **45 seconds** |

---

## 💬 MAKE IT REAL:

> "Let's do some math together. Industry research puts the **fully-loaded cost** of manually processing one invoice at **$15 to $25 dollars.** That's not just salary — that's the back-and-forth, the corrections, the filing, the looking-it-up-later."

**Build to the punchline:**
> "If you're processing 100 invoices a month at $20 each... that's **$24,000 a year.** Just in processing cost. Not the goods — just the PAPERWORK."

**Twist the knife:**
- That doesn't count **late payment fees** when things get lost in the shuffle
- It doesn't count the hours spent on **vendor disputes** because someone typed a wrong number
- It's pure **waste.** Labor is expensive, and data entry adds zero value.

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"Now — some of you are probably thinking: 'We've tried scanning documents. We looked at OCR. It didn't really work.' Am I right? Let me explain why that happened, and what's different now..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 5: WHY TRADITIONAL OCR ISN'T ENOUGH
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Validate their past frustrations. Then show them why this time is different.**

---

## 💬 ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR SKEPTICISM:

> "If you've tried document scanning before and been disappointed... you're not alone. Traditional OCR has been around for decades, and for most use cases, it just doesn't cut it."

**Explain the fundamental limitation:**
> "Here's the problem: OCR reads characters. It sees '1-0-0' on a page. But it has NO IDEA if that's a **quantity, a price, a lot number, or part of a date.** It's like hiring someone who can read the letters but **doesn't actually speak the language.**"

**Make it concrete:**
- Handwriting? Traditional OCR gets maybe **60% accuracy.** That's almost half wrong.
- Different invoice layouts? It breaks.
- A vendor changes their form? It breaks again.

---

## 🎤 PERSONAL STORY (if time):

> "I'll share a quick example. I built a system for a client — they were collecting business cards at conferences and needed to get that data into their CRM. Traditional approach: OCR extracts the text, then you use something called **regex** — pattern matching — to figure out what's what. 'This looks like a phone number, this looks like an email...'"

> "The problem? I had to maintain these massive lists. Is this a job title? Well, 'Real Estate Agent' is. But so is 'Property Specialist.' And 'Real Estate Broker.' And 'Realty Consultant.' You keep adding synonyms, and the system STILL breaks on the next card because there's always something new."

> "It was **fragile.** Constantly breaking. Because fundamentally — **it didn't actually KNOW what it was looking at.** It was just pattern matching."

---

**Pivot to the solution:**
> "Modern AI is fundamentally different. It doesn't just see characters — it UNDERSTANDS context. It knows: 'This is an invoice from Supplier X. The total is HERE. The PO number is THERE. And this handwritten note says...' — it actually comprehends."

---

## 📊 THE PROOF:
**Deliveroo achieved 97.6% accuracy** with intelligent document processing. Not OCR — intelligent processing.

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"So what makes this 'intelligent' processing actually work? Let me break down the architecture..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 6: INTELLIGENT DOCUMENT PROCESSING
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**IDP is the technical framework. Make it memorable with the "new employee" analogy.**

---

## 💬 USE THIS ANALOGY:

> "Think about a new employee on their first day. You hand them an invoice — they can READ it, sure, but they don't know where to put the data, what to check it against, whether it looks right. Now think about that same person after a YEAR. They look at an invoice and instantly know: 'This is from our tomato supplier, the PO matches, the price is normal, route it to Accounts Payable.'"

**Land the insight:**
> "Intelligent Document Processing is like having that **experienced employee** — but one who never takes a day off, never gets tired, and processes documents in seconds instead of minutes."

**Walk through the five steps:**
1. **CLASSIFY** — AI identifies: "This is an invoice from Vendor X, not a packing slip"
2. **EXTRACT** — Pulls the relevant data: "Total is $4,500, PO# is 12345, due date is..."
3. **VALIDATE** — Cross-checks: "Does this match what we ordered? Is the price right?"
4. **INTEGRATE** — If everything checks out → auto-posts to your accounting system
5. **LEARN** — Every correction makes it smarter for next time

---

## 🌱 GREENHOUSE HOOK:
> "The result? Your team only sees the **exceptions** — the things that actually need human judgment. The routine stuff just... processes."

---

## 🎤 REAL EXAMPLE (if time):

> "I built a system like this for a client in the startup incubation space. They'd go to these conferences — 'Inventive Vacations' they called them — and come back with stacks of business cards. The old way? Someone would spend HOURS manually typing everything into a spreadsheet. Then more hours crafting individual follow-up emails. The whole process would drag across weeks."

> "The problem? **By the time they reached out, those leads had forgotten their faces.** The impression they made at the conference had faded."

> "The new system: scan the card, AI extracts and categorizes into their CRM, drafts a personalized email, connects to Gmail, sends. **Same day.** While the connection is still fresh."

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"Let me show you what this workflow actually looks like in practice..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 7: THE IDP WORKFLOW
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Walk through the 5 steps visually. Use the interactive diagram.**

---

## 💬 KEY LINES:

> "You can zoom in on this diagram..."

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. CAPTURE | Document arrives (email, scan, upload) |
| 2. CLASSIFY | AI identifies type, routes accordingly |
| 3. EXTRACT | Pulls relevant fields based on doc type |
| 4. VALIDATE | Cross-checks against your business rules |
| 5. INTEGRATE | Pushes to ERP, triggers workflows |

**"The magic is in steps 2-4. That's where AI replaces someone sitting at a desk typing."**

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"What made this actually work well is a recent AI breakthrough..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 8: THE LLM REVOLUTION
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**This is the "why now" slide. Explain what changed in the last 2 years that made all this actually work.**

---

## 💬 SET UP THE BREAKTHROUGH:

> "I need to explain why this is working NOW when similar promises have been made before. Something fundamental changed in 2023."

**Contrast the old way:**
> "Traditional document AI needed **thousands of training examples.** You'd show the system a hundred invoices from one vendor, and MAYBE it could handle that vendor's format. New vendor? Start over. Different layout? Start over. It was expensive, slow, and fragile."

**Reveal the breakthrough:**
> "Large Language Models changed that equation completely. An LLM **already understands** that 'Invoice Total' and 'Amount Due' and 'Grand Total' all mean the same thing. It understands context the way a human does."

---

## 🎤 CALLBACK TO EARLIER STORY (if you told it):

> "Remember the business card system I mentioned? Once I added an LLM layer, everything changed. I stopped trying to teach the system what a job title looks like. Instead: **just extract everything. Let the AI figure out which is which.**"

> "It went from constantly breaking to **98% accuracy.** Because the AI actually KNOWS that 'Property Specialist' and 'Real Estate Agent' mean the same thing. I didn't have to teach it — it already understood."

---

**Make it tangible:**
- New supplier with a weird invoice format? **The AI figures it out.**
- Handwritten notes on a form? **It reads them in context.**
- Multiple languages in one document? **No problem.**

---

## 📊 PROOF POINT:
**Wolt** — the food delivery company — processes invoices in **9+ languages across 11 countries.** They've had **30% volume growth** with the **same headcount** in AP.

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"So with that foundation — what kinds of documents can this technology actually handle? The answer might surprise you..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 9: WHAT WE CAN PROCESS
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Expand their imagination. The scope is bigger than they think.**

---

## 💬 OPEN IT UP:

> "So what kinds of documents can this actually handle? The short answer: **if a human can read it, AI can too.**"

**Walk through the list:**
- ✓ **Invoices and POs** — any format, any vendor, any layout
- ✓ **Bills of lading and shipping documents** — the stuff that comes with every shipment
- ✓ **Delivery receipts** — even with signatures and handwritten notes
- ✓ **Quality certificates and lab reports** — including the weird formatting from third-party labs
- ✓ **Compliance documentation** — food safety certs, audit forms, inspection records
- ✓ **Even handwritten forms** — yes, really. The AI can read handwriting.

---

## 🌱 GREENHOUSE SPECIFIC:
> "For produce operations specifically: phytosanitary certificates, pesticide application records, harvest logs, pack date documentation, temperature logs from cold chain... all of it."

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"Now, here's something important to understand — AI isn't always 100% confident in what it reads. And that's actually a FEATURE, not a bug. Let me explain..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 10: CONFIDENCE SCORING
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**This is what makes AI trustworthy. It knows what it doesn't know.**

---

## 💬 EXPLAIN WHY THIS MATTERS:

> "Here's what makes modern AI different from a black box: **it tells you how confident it is.** Every field, every extraction, comes with a confidence score."

**Walk through the thresholds:**

| Confidence | What Happens |
|------------|--------------|
| **95%+** | Auto-process — no human needed |
| **70-95%** | Flag for quick review — human glances at it |
| **<70%** | Route to human expert — AI is saying "I'm not sure" |

**Drive home the insight:**
> "This is crucial for trust. The AI isn't a black box making decisions you can't see. **It shows its work.** And critically — **it knows when to ask for help.**"

---

## 🎤 MAKE IT HUMAN:

> "When the confidence is low — maybe there was a glare on the scan, or the handwriting was messy, or something just doesn't look right — the AI essentially says: **'Hey boss, I'm not too sure about this one. Could you take a look?'**"

> "That's not a weakness. That's exactly what you WANT. An AI that knows the limits of its own confidence."

---

## 📊 THE PROOF:
- **Adyen** — the global payments company — achieves **93.4% accuracy** on first pass
- With human review on flagged items? They hit **99%+** overall

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"Which brings us to the question everyone's really thinking about: how do humans fit into this system?"**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 11: HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Address the unspoken fear in the room. This isn't about replacing people — it's about upgrading what they do.**

---

## 💬 ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT:

> "I want to be really clear about something, because I know there's a question in this room that no one's asking out loud: 'Are you talking about replacing my team?'"

**Answer it directly:**
> "No. Here's what actually happens: When the AI is confident, it processes automatically. When it's NOT confident — when something looks unusual or doesn't match — **it routes to a human.** Your people are still making the decisions that matter. They're just not doing the repetitive typing anymore."

**Explain the virtuous cycle:**
- Human reviews the flagged item
- **One click** to approve, correct, or escalate
- Every correction **teaches the system** — it gets smarter
- Over time, fewer things need review

**Land the key insight:**
> "Nobody's job becomes 'type data from one screen to another.' That's waste. Their job becomes 'exercise judgment on the things that actually matter.'"

---

## 📊 THE PROOF:
**Thermo Fisher** runs 53% of their invoices "touchless" — **400,000+ invoices per year** with zero human touch. The other 47%? Reviewed by humans. The humans focus ONLY on what needs their attention.

---

## 🌱 GREENHOUSE HOOK:
> "Imagine your accounting person doing actual ACCOUNTING. Analysis. Vendor negotiations. Cash flow planning. Instead of copying numbers from PDFs."

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"Let's talk about what this looks like in business terms — the actual ROI companies are seeing..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 12: THE ADOPTION WAVE
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Create urgency through FOMO. This isn't experimental anymore — it's mainstream.**

---

## 📊 THE ADOPTION NUMBERS:

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| Enterprises using AI | **78%** (up from 55% last year) |
| Large enterprises with AI | **87%** |
| IDP market by 2032 | **$17.8 billion** |

---

## 💬 CREATE THE URGENCY:

> "I want to put this technology in context. This isn't early-adopter territory anymore. This isn't experimental."

**Land the stats:**
> "**78% of enterprises** are now using AI in some form — that's up from 55% just last year. Among large enterprises? **87%.** The IDP market specifically is projected to hit **$17.8 billion** by 2032."

**Reframe the question:**
> "The question isn't WHETHER this technology works. The proof is everywhere. The question is: **do you want to be ahead of your competitors, or behind them?**"

---

## ❓ ENGAGE THE ROOM:
> "Quick show of hands — who's already using some form of document automation in their operation? Even basic scanning?"
*(Take note of responses — acknowledge the range)*

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"So we know adoption is happening. But what kind of returns are companies actually seeing? Let me show you the numbers..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 13: THE ROI REALITY
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Credibility through specifics. These are public numbers from name-brand companies.**

---

## 📊 THE BIG NUMBERS:

| Company | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **Coca-Cola** | €17M savings, 580K hours recovered |
| **Deliveroo** | 23x efficiency, 15 min → 45 sec |
| **Thermo Fisher** | 70% time reduction |
| **Payback** | 5-12 months |

---

## 💬 DELIVER WITH WEIGHT:

> "I want to show you some numbers. And I want to be clear — these aren't projections. These aren't 'potential savings.' These are **published results** from companies you've heard of."

**Walk through each one:**
- **Coca-Cola's** European operations saved €17 million euros and recovered 580,000 hours of labor
- **Deliveroo** went from 15 minutes per invoice to 45 seconds — that's **23x efficiency**
- **Thermo Fisher** — a $40 billion scientific company — cut document processing time by 70%

**Drive home the payback:**
> "And the typical payback period? **5 to 12 months.** This isn't a multi-year initiative. This is something you can see results from THIS YEAR."

---

## 🌱 GREENHOUSE HOOK:
> "Those hours saved aren't just cost savings on a spreadsheet. They're hours that go back to **production.** To **quality control.** To actually **growing things** instead of processing paperwork."

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"Let me rapid-fire through a few more examples to give you a sense of the range..."**

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 15: THE "TOUCHLESS" INVOICE
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**The goal = invoices that process themselves.**

---

## 💬 THE FLOW:

1. Invoice arrives by email
2. AI extracts vendor, PO#, line items, totals
3. System matches to purchase order
4. Three-way match: PO vs Invoice vs Receipt
5. If matched → **auto-approve, post, schedule payment**
6. **Human never sees it**

> **"Your team only sees EXCEPTIONS — the 10% that actually have issues."**

---

## 📊 STAT:
**Thermo Fisher:** 53% touchless = **400,000+ invoices/year** zero human touch

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"Let's be honest about what this investment looks like..."**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 16: COST VS BENEFIT
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Be honest about costs. Frame as investment vs return.**

---

## 💬 KEY LINES:

**COSTS:**
- Initial: software, integration, training (~12 weeks)
- Ongoing: subscription, maintenance

**RETURNS:**
- Labor savings, faster processing, fewer errors
- Audit readiness, compliance confidence
- Team working on **meaningful tasks**

---

## 📊 STAT:
**Typical payback: 5-12 months**

---

## 💡 THE FRAME:
> **"The question isn't whether you can AFFORD to do this. It's whether you can afford NOT to."**

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 17: SHIPPING & RECEIVING
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Bring it to THEIR world. This is the use case they'll see in the demo.**

---

## 💬 CONNECT TO THEIR REALITY:

> "Let me bring this back to something very concrete for produce operations: shipping and receiving. This is where documents COLLIDE."

**Paint the complexity:**
> "Think about it — for one shipment, you've got FIVE different data sources that should all agree:"

| Source | What It Is |
|--------|------------|
| 1. **Purchase Order** | What you ORDERED |
| 2. **Bill of Lading** | What the vendor says they SHIPPED |
| 3. **Invoice** | What the vendor is CHARGING you |
| 4. **Delivery Receipt** | What your team SIGNED for |
| 5. **Actual Count** | What was REALLY there when you opened the boxes |

**Land the insight:**
> "In a manual world, reconciling these five sources is a headache. It happens late. Discrepancies get discovered weeks later when you're trying to pay the invoice. With AI? **All five get compared automatically. Instantly. The moment something doesn't match, you know about it.**"

---

## 🌱 GREENHOUSE HOOK:
> "Produce operations move FAST. Product is perishable. You can't let a discrepancy sit for a week — by then the evidence is literally rotting."

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"And here's what makes this powerful — when the AI finds a problem, it doesn't just flag it. It routes it INTELLIGENTLY..."**

# 📍 SLIDE 18: INTELLIGENT ESCALATION
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**AI doesn't just find problems — it routes them to the RIGHT person.**

---

## 💬 KEY LINES:

| Severity | Example | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Minor** | Ordered 100, got 97 | Log it, don't interrupt |
| **Significant** | Ordered 100, got 50 | Alert receiving manager |
| **Wrong product** | Tomato seeds → cucumber | Immediate escalation |
| **Safety issue** | Contamination | Notify safety + management |

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 19: THE DATA FLOW
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Documents are ONE piece of a bigger unified data system.**

---

## 💬 KEY LINES:

> "Documents are one input. Unified insights are the output."

**SOURCES:** ERP, climate systems, labor tracking, inventory, shipping
**OUTPUT:**
- Leadership → **KPI dashboards**
- Operations → **real-time alerts**
- Growers → **predictions**

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 20: DATA ARCHITECTURE
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**For technical folks. Use the interactive diagram.**

---

## 💬 KEY LINES:

> "This is the detailed view. You can zoom in to explore."

**Sources → ETL → Data Lake → AI Layer → Users**

*"Documents aren't siloed anymore. They're part of the same infrastructure as everything else."*

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 21: KPI TRANSFORMATION
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Before/after. From chaos to clarity.**

---

## 💬 KEY LINES:

| BEFORE | AFTER |
|--------|-------|
| Scattered spreadsheets | Unified data |
| Manual reconciliation | Automated processing |
| Reports take days | Same-day visibility |

> **"Nobody's job is pulling data into spreadsheets anymore. The data FLOWS."**

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"So how do you actually start?"**

---

---

---

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 📍 SLIDE 22: GETTING STARTED
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 THE POINT:
**Remove the "this is too big" objection. Show them the practical first step.**

---

## 💬 MAKE IT APPROACHABLE:

> "If you're thinking 'this sounds great but it's a huge undertaking' — let me reframe that. You don't have to automate everything at once. That's not how successful implementations work."

**Walk through the path:**

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| 1 | **Pick ONE high-volume document type** — usually invoices |
| 2 | **Pilot for 30-60 days** — small scope, contained risk |
| 3 | **Measure what matters** — accuracy, time saved, exceptions rate |
| 4 | **Expand** — add more document types as you prove the model |
| 5 | **Integrate** — connect to ERP, automate end-to-end |

**Set expectations:**
> "From kickoff to production value? **3 to 6 months.** That's not a multi-year transformation. That's a project with a real end date and measurable results."

---

## 💡 THE CALL TO ACTION:
> **"Start with the pain point that's most acute. Get a win. Build credibility. Then expand from there. That's how this actually works."**

---

## ➡️ TRANSITION:
> **"Alright — we've covered a lot of theory. Now let me show you what this actually LOOKS like when it's running..."**

## 💬 BUILD ANTICIPATION:

> "Alright. We've covered a lot of ground — the problem, the technology, the results. But talking ABOUT something isn't the same as SEEING it work."

**Set up what's coming:**
> "What you're about to see is a working document processing pipeline. We're going to take a document through the entire flow — capture, classification, extraction, validation, and routing. You'll see the AI's confidence scores. You'll see how exceptions get handled. You'll see the data flow from document to dashboard."

**Make it participatory:**
> "And here's the fun part — **you're going to be part of it.** There will be QR codes you can scan with your phone. You'll submit data. You'll see your inputs flow through the system in real-time. You're not just watching a demo — **you're INSIDE the data pipeline.**"

## 🎤 ENERGY CUE:
> **"So — get your phones out. Make sure you're connected to WiFi. And let's see what intelligent document processing actually looks like when it's running."**

**LABOR:** *"Finding good labor is hard enough. Data entry is expensive waste."*

**MARGINS:** *"Ag runs on tight margins. Manual processing adds ZERO value."*

**COMPLIANCE:** *"Audits are a fact of life. Searchable docs vs. filing cabinets."*

**SEASONALITY:** *"Volume spikes at harvest. Manual doesn't scale. Automated does."*

**PERISHABILITY:** *"Can't let a discrepancy sit for a week. Product's rotted by then."*
